FILE STRUCTURE

1. For backend, make it a 3 way architecture. Routes <--> Service <--> Models. Never pass req to Service, put your business logics in Service,
 and one Model per schema.

2. For frontend, separate Smart and Dumb Components. In this file structure, we have dumb component in the /components folder, and smart components in
 the /pages folder. HOCs and Wrappers can go to /component root, and the rest of dumb components can be made with generate-react-cli


PROJECT WORKFLOW

1. Backend and Frontend has their own port, run separately. Pages of frontend can be nested by child, for example. /RolesForm can reside in /Roles folder
2. Pages are declared static on AppRoutes.js, so even though you added data inside the database, you would still need to declare it in AppRoutes.js



Class Components vs Functional Components.

1. The following components are made with Class:

 - Users
 - UsersForm
 - Roles
 - RolesForm
 - RouteRolesForm
 - PageRolesForm
 - ParentMenus
 - ParentMenusForm
 - Login
 - Table
 - Spinner
 - Sidebar
 - Select
 - Pagination
 - Navbar
 - Footer
 - RequireAuth
 - RequireLogin
 - RequireLogout

2. The following components are made with Function:

 - TextFormField
 - SelectFormField
 - Menus
 - MenusForm

Note: try to use hooks everytime, so starting on July 2021, all of my components are written with Functional Components


Important Pattern Lessons for React

1. Have an individual states and don't use nested states. 
2. setters from useState hooks don't receive callbacks and not immediately updating, so use useEffect and watch for the state instead.
3. Custom Hooks:
    3.1. Components for UI, Hooks for Behavior. Never return a jsx, or component with Custom Hooks.
4. Optimization with useMemo, useCallback
    4.1. Each hook has cost, so beware on using them. Only use them if it will skip large rerenders, or to function and/or component
        that rarely affected throughout the workflow. Read: https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback
5. useEffect
    5.1. Don't lie about dependencies array, fix your code if its producing infinite loop with the required dependencies
